* Name and address of the insurance company (Mutuelle Centrale Marocaine d'Assurances in the example)

II. Identification of the Assured

* Effective date of the policy
* Expiration date of the policy
* Renewal or tacit renewal information (as mentioned in the example)

IV. School Information
